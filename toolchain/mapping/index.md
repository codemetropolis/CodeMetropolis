This application is used to process the XML file generated by the CDF Converter Tool, assigns metrics to objects of the metropolis and generates an output XML that is ready to be used by CodeMetropolis Placing Tool. The tool is using the mapping file to link source code elements and metrics to world objects. For example, link of the LOC metric is related to the height of the building. The *source* tag contains the metric that will be a link to the object, the *name* parameter is the element of the source code and the *from* parameter is the metric. The *target* parameter is the world object, the *name* parameter is the name of the element in the city and the *to* parameter is the property of the element. If the value of the metric doesn't fit the world element, you have to use conversion. 

**Usage**: `java -jar mapping.jar -i <inputFile> -m <mappingFile> [-o <outputFile>]`

**Command line options:**  

* `-h`: help, shows the usage of the command line tool.  
* `-i`: input, the path of the input XML file generated by the Converter Tool. Required.  
* `-o`: output, which will be generated to the given path. Default: "mappingToPlacing.xml".  
* `-m`: mapping, path of the input mapping file. Required.  
* `-s`: scale. Set the scale of blocks. Default: 1.0  
* `-v`: validate. Default: false. In case of true, the tool will validate the generated structure elements, if it's false, the invalid structure elements will be thrown. 

**About the mapping file**  

Mapping tool uses an XML file to determine the bindings from source elements to buildings of the world.
Editing this file allows you to use the city metaphors the way you want. You may place monster spawners, too. Mapping XMLs must follow a specific format.

~~~ xml
<linking source="method" target="floor">
	<binding from="LLOC" to="height"/>
	<binding from="NII" to="width"/>
	<binding from="NOI" to="length"/>
	<binding from="McCC" to="character">
		<conversions>
			<conversion type="quantization">
				<parameter name="level0" value="glass"/>
				<parameter name="level1" value="sand"/>
				<parameter name="level2" value="planks"/>
				<parameter name="level3" value="stone"/>
				<parameter name="level4" value="obsidian"/>
			</conversion>
		</conversions>
    </binding>
</linking>
~~~

In the `<linking>` tag it can be set how a program element should be displayed in the world. The `source` must be an existing type of the input CDF, while the `target` specifies the building type to which the source will be linked to. The valid building types are the following: `ground`, `garden`, `floor`, `cellar`.

The bindings are used to tell the mapping component which properties of the source element to bind to which attribute of the target object. The table below shows the currently supported attributes.

| attribute           | type             | targets       | description                                                            |
| ------------------- |:----------------:|:-------------:| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| width               | integer          | floor, cellar | size near X                                                            |
| height              | integer          | floor, cellar | size near Y                                                            |
| length              | integer          | floor, cellar | size near Z                                                            |
| character*          | string           | floor, cellar | primary material the structure is made of                              |
| external_character* | string           | floor, cellar | secondary material the structure is made of                            |
| torches             | integer (0 to 5) | floor, cellar | quantity of torches, bigger value means smaller spaces between torches |
| flower-ratio        | float (0 to 1)   | garden        | quantity of flowers                                                    |
| tree-ratio          | float (0 to 1)   | garden        | quantity of trees                                                      |
| mushroom-ratio      | float (0 to 1)   | garden        | quantity of mushrooms                                                  |
| monster-count**       | integer (0 to 4) | garden        | quantity of monster spawners to place
| monster-label**       | string           | garden        | signpost label for monster spawners

**\*supported values:** stone, cobblestone, mossy_stone, sandstone, obsidian, wood, dark_wood, birch_wood, planks, dark_planks, metal, dirt, sand, red_sand, brick, stone_brick, dark_brick, glass, gold, diamond

**\*\*** the monster spawners will be placed along the sides, near the buildings' entrances.

Sometimes a source value doesn't fit the world element we use as target. In this case, we use conversions. At the moment, the following conversions are available:

  * `to int`
  * `to double`
  * `multiply`
  * `quantization`
  * `normalize`
  * `switch`

The next example show a quantization conversion.

~~~ xml  
<conversion type="quantization">
	<parameter name="level0" value="1"/>
	<parameter name="level1" value="2"/>
</conversion>

The project includes several example mapping files that allow you to quickly build worlds from the input XMLs. The examples demonstrate how you can use different bindings and conversions. They also show how monster spawners can be placed in the generated world.
